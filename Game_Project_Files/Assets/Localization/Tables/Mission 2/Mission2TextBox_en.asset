    m_Localized: This is the aquifer I told you about. Until a few years ago, it
      had twice the flow and supplied more homes.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1046979211264
    m_Localized: Is it all right if I take a look at the area?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1683884273664
    m_Localized: Of course, be my guest!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1968996282368
    m_Localized: The flow rate is really low...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 2712348585984
    m_Localized: I feel there should be a lot more vegetation here.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4095248363520
    m_Localized: Wow, how many bifurcations, this aquifer must supply several cities,
      with several different rulers, will they all agree?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4344037699584
    m_Localized: I noticed that the vegetation here was recently cut down, do you
      know why?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4766567690240
    m_Localized: They recently passed a law reducing the minimum percentage of native
      vegetation on each property, and most of them ended up giving in and deforesting.
      It's absurd, if you ask me.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 5128901029888
    m_Localized: Wow, let me look into this...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: 'In urban areas, the suppression of Cerrado Biome vegetation for
      land parceling or any building, subject to the provisions of the municipality''s
      master plan and other applicable rules, will depend on prior authorization

  - m_Id: 7090916749312
    m_Localized: Wow, I heard something sad, I was even going to ask your opinion
      on how to proceed... speaking of which, what's that good smell?

    m_Localized: So, today I visited an aquifer with low flow, and I found out that
      they recently passed a law changing the percentage of minimum vegetation on
      properties. Do you think this is related?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 8657610928128
    m_Localized: See well....(reference to scientific research on minimal vegetation).
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 9217311436800
    m_Localized: And do you think there is any way to remedy this?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 9673215504384
    m_Localized: Maybe if you can prove it and convince the Basin Committee, they
      can put pressure on the local government and go back to the way things were
      before.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      I'm here to present some options that could help improve this problem."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11306800443392
    m_Localized: Oh, that's interesting about reforestation. But what about the economic
      issue, what about the landowners in the region? They need to produce.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11546462973952
    m_Localized: And what do you propose we do about it?
